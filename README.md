 ~~~
 This is a coding example working on IRIS 2020.1 and on Caché 2018.1.3 
 It will not be kept in sync with new versions      
 It is also NOT serviced by InterSystems Support !   
~~~ 

If your Apache Server (httpd) to service the System Management Portal  
doesn't run (anymore) fo any reason then system administration can become  
a hard job. In the case a restart of IRIS / Caché / Ensemble is NOT  
possible this example might be a workaround.  
The only limit is the lack of enough privileges to start httpd.  
( e.g with docker images)

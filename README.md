If your Apache Server (httpd) to service the System Management Portal  
doesn't run (anymore) for any reason then system administration can become  
a hard job. In the case a restart of IRIS / Cach√© / Ensemble is NOT  
possible this example might provide a workaround.  
The only limit is the lack of enough privileges to start httpd.  
( e.g with docker images)
